### 1.3. Design ###
 
- **Colour Scheme**: The colours have been selected to compliment the original graphic which features on every page of the site.
 
<h2 align="center"><img src="./assets/images/header-graphic.png"><img src="./readme-docs/palette.png"></h2>
 
- Kingfisher Turquoise #79b4b7 - This forms the colour of the navigation section, sitewide background, h2 & h3 tags
- Home Plate #f8f0df - This is used as the background of the section area, nav & socials icons
- Black Olive #3b3b38 - This used for the footer, text and the selected nav icons
- Golden West #e9cf96 - This is used in the footer text
- Litewood #e5decf - This is used for a contrast panels
 
- **Typography**: The site uses 2 fonts, Firstly for the body text and buttons Montserrat font was the choice, Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate. Secondly for the headings, navigation text and to display the results Teko is the choice, this is a slim font allowing for more content to be displayed in a small area. Both fonts have Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
 
- **Imagery**: This simple clean site design only contains one graphic of a character of Barry busy working at his desk. This graphic is overlaid with 2 animated gifs.

The talking mouth and blinking eyes of the character.
 
### 1.4. Wireframes ###
