## Browser Compatibility
This site was tested on the following browsers with no visible issues for the user. Google Chrome, Safari and Mozilla Firefox. Appearance, functionality and responsiveness were consistent throughout for a range of device sizes and browsers.
 
Note: Currently on wide displays the site begins to look sparse, therefore the site should maybe have a max width set in order to hold a neat structure for the site across all devices.

## 4. Bugs
---
 
-   Detailed below are the errors found and actions taken to resolve them.
 
 
- One of the major bugs I found during the development process was the issue of cross device compatibility with the original design as seen in the wireframes..
    - This was solved with some reconfiguration of the layout using the bootstrap elements.
 
- When browsing the site on mobile, there was an unwanted sideways scroll.
    - This was solved by making the images decrease in size based on the width of the screen.
